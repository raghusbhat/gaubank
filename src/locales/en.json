    "description": "Bharatiya Gou-Bank is a unique initiative conceptualized by His Holiness Shree Shree Raghaveshwara Bharathi Mahaswamiji. This groundbreaking project marks a significant step towards protection and welfare of Indian Indigenous Cow [Goumatha]. The Gou-Bank provides a sanctuary for cows, ensuring their survival and well-being. ",
    "description2": "When farmers find it uneconomical to maintain unproductive cows, they can leave them at the Gou-Bank instead of selling them to slaughterhouses. The Gou-Bank will take care of these cows. For those interested in rearing cows and bullocks, the Gou-Bank donates them free of cost from its existing stock. This initiative addresses the distressing trend of selling cows to butchers when they are no longer deemed useful. By donating these cows to the Gou-Bank, they are given a new lease on life. ",
    "description3": "The primary objective of this scheme is to protect and nurture such cattle. The Gou-Bank also cares for cattle injured in accidents, neglected by careless owners, deserted, or seized by local authorities during unlawful transportation to slaughterhouses."
